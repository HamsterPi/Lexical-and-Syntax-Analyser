Assignment 1
Assignment 1: A Lexical and Syntax Analyser

The aim of this assignment is to implement a lexical and syntax analyser using Antlr4 for a simple language called CAL.

The details of the CAL language are given here.

Submission
This is an individual assignment. You should submit, by email to david.sinclair@dcu.ie, all the source files (Antlr4 grammar file and other Java files which were used to generate your parser) in a Winzip file along with a declaration that this is solely your own work (except elements that are explicitly attributed to another source), a brief description of each of the major components of your lexical and syntax analyser that describes how you implemented them, by 10am on Monday 16th November 2020.

The parser and supporting code must be written in Java.

The paerser should take a file name as an input, say file.cal, and output one of the following messages if the input parsed successfully or did not parse respectively.

file.cal parsed successfully
file.cal has not parsed
